# ZeroEnqueue

***Feel hungry while queueing for your food? Is there a way to reduce the time needed to get your meals on campus?***

Many have reached the end of the queue just to find out their favourite food has been sold out. Others might just feel that queueing is a waste of time which can be spent more productively. Some are unsure of which food is value for money and find it a hassle to go down in person to every food stall just to compare which food is the best. On the flip side, stall vendors also find it difficult to advertise their food, as stated by the reason above. There is also the problem of food wastage as stall vendors are unable to predict how much food they need to prepare for the day. 

Therefore, we decided to come up with an application for customers to be able to order their food ahead of time and for stall vendors to better accommodate the needs of the customer.

ZeroEnqueue will be an Android mobile app to support an online ordering platform for a wide variety of food stalls.

Zeroenqueueâ€™s features will take inspiration from other food ordering apps such as GrabFood, foodpanda, Deliveroo etc. Specific app features will be further elaborated in the following sections.

We hope to streamline the process of ordering food through a convenient and intuitive user interface. This speeds up the ordering of food and makes the entire process a more pleasant experience. Customers can also make better informed decisions on what food they might buy through the recommendations of the other users.

This is our Year 1 Summer Project for NUS Orbital 2022.
